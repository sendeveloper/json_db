Preferably a podiatrist.</p>\n        <p>Don't be fooled by the \"before and after\" pictures of &nbsp;toenails and fingernails on the boxes of over-the-counter antifungal liquid advertised for nail fungus. If you read carefully, it would tell you it is not effective on nails. Go figure.</p>\n        <p>What they are effective for is the surrounding areas and not the nail plate. The reasoning is that some toenail fungi infection do spread to the surrounding skin area and some do come with athlete's foot.
